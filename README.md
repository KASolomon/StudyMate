# StudyMate
The project sought to help students set and achieve reasonable academic goals for a semester. This was done using their current CWA (Cumulative Weighted Average), a target CWA, their semester courses and their respective credit hours. Using this information, the application computes target scores for each respective course which if attained will give the student the desired CWA increase for that semester. This was implemented using Expo React Native, NativeBase and React Native AsyncStorage.
